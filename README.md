# An AngularJS Front End I was building for the ASP.NET WEB API back end 
## Was building this UI while working for the San Joaquin Country Office of Education

----

**Built this UI on top of the hotTowel spa template by John Papa.**

----

`Every SPA (Single Page Application) needs a Hot Towel (some boilerplate code to get it started:)`

This is the ng-hot-towel spa template available from nuget. 

This is the repo I am using to push changes to:
[Williams Act Frontend](http://wa2-cedr.azurewebsites.net) for the San Joaquin Country Office of Education

via my [Visual Studio Team Services](https://nodeninja.visualstudio.com)
repo
